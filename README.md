# Syntalos Archiver

This small tool will pack directories of scientific data efficiently,
so they are compressed and in a single file for easy transmission to
collaborators or for archival puproses.

At the same time, if/when the data is needed again, they can be read
efficiently and with random access, so only the necessary files will
be decompressed.
